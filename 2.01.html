						<span id="afterwards-title1">CALLING ALL IMAGINATIONS:
						<br> a note from the editor </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						Last summer in Baltimore, just a few months following the Baltimore Uprising, I started reaching out to possible collaborators for a project that has now become If I Ruled The World. At that time, it felt like the most important thing for me to do was to be present with other people who cohabitate the city; to be as aware as possible of the people around me and the vastly different experiences of this city that we all have. I’m not sure that I was able to discreetly identify this at the time, just like I didn’t know exactly why I was starting this project, but somehow this collection of works and conversations came out of that attempt to be fully present. Starting at that moment, and over the past couple months in Baltimore, for me, to be fully present meant having conversations, or listening in on conversations, that investigate where freedom and joy exists in Baltimore and where freedom and joy could, but does not yet, exist in Baltimore. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The prompt, taken from Nas’ song “If I Ruled The World” (It Was Written, 1996) featuring Lauryn Hill, is a contradiction itself; on one hand, it asserts that everyone has the right to take up space and envision the world as they want it, but on the other, it claims an old-school, hierarchical way of structuring life. However outdated this question might be, it prompted a series of collaborative, artistic responses and conversations by Baltimore-based creatives and activists, some of which, attempted to find a contemporary way of asking the question itself. Artistic collaborators who stepped into this project, did not only contribute content but also defined the direction of the entire project and identified new collaborators to pull in. Thus, this collection of unique voices, works and conversations grew organically over the past few months.
						<br>
						<br>
						The pieces in this work evolved to approach a range of issues; from the different forms that activism can take, to the role of artists in a struggle for equity, to normalized violence and all the way to strategic plans for the city. Most importantly, this project called on us to collaboratively imagine new, positive visions for our world and how we want to exist within it. 
						<br>
						<br>
						We all have the power to imagine the world as we want it to be. This is a call for collaborative imagination. What if you ruled the world?

							A conversation with Kate Khatib
							<br> and Kimi Hanauer
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: So one of the things that I think that is interesting that came up a few times throughout this project is humor. So I came into politics through Surrealism, and that’s a big part of Surrealism, American Surrealism specifically; the way that we use humor and cultural forms, and the way that poetry itself can be a form of resistance. I think what’s interesting about this project-- is that it speaks to this question of, why make it so multi-faceted? Why bring in so many different elements? I think that’s one of the things that is potentially revolutionary about it, the fact that it can transcend the boundaries of one medium.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">
							KH: I really didn’t want to limit the ways in which people could participate or the form they could participate through. There are obvious constraint of course, but opening it up as much as possible was one of the things I really tried to do. What your saying reminds me of my conversation with Bonnie, where she talked a lot about how poetry is really good at confusing power through language. She talked a lot about how we are all the full spectrum of human consciousness, because we are all human beings, even though we come with vastly different experiences. That, and how powerful language is.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: Language is one of the most powerful and terrifying realms that we have available to us. It’s interesting because there’s this question of freedom that runs through this project as a thread, and one of the things that I’ve been thinking about lately, which I feel has some relevance here, is this notion that sometimes the most powerful act is the refusal to engage on someone else’s terms. That came up for me because one of the things that we’ve been thinking through at Red Emma’s is how we want to interact with people around the language that they use to talk to us and about us. Because we are a collective that has a lot of folks coming from different and many historically marginalized communities--folks who have traditionally been denied a voice in a lot of different contexts--one of the things we’re dealing with now, is working on creating a space where we are able to define the way we are talked about and how we talk about each other. That’s not something that can really be done easily when you run a public space that has a lot of people going through it. So that’s something that we’ve been talking about--do you always have to engage? Or sometimes is it more powerful to simply refuse to engage?
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: It’s a way of taking back the power in that situation. Bryanna also talked about that in here, about how there is power in who and to what you answer to. </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: Exactly. One of the things that we have to remind ourselves is that we don’t always have to answer to everyone, we can say this is not a conversation we are interested in having. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Yeah. When thinking about creating “safe” public spaces that are open and tolerant, the question that comes up for me is at what point do you say no? Being accepting and tolerant can also mean being accepting of things that are fucked up. So how do you know where to draw the line?</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: I think its the critical question we always come back to. When you talk about creating spaces that are free and safe, there’s this one little problematic note that you always forget to sound, that a safe space to one person isn’t the same to someone else. The things that one person might need to feel ok, to feel like they have power and respect, is sometimes totally antithetical to what someone else might need. I think it’s a constant negotiation that takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of energy. This is something I was thinking about before this conversation, that, if I ruled the world, my vision for the world is that nobody rules it. It’s that we manage to create structures that are both freeing and collaborative at the same time. But I always come back to this notion of how do you negotiate that contradiction? How do you build structures that create space for everyone to feel safe and start working towards building shared languages, understanding at the same time that if we are demanding that everyone uses the same language, we are also in some ways limiting people’s ability to express themselves in a manner that feels most comfortable to them. It’s really difficult and it’s the central question we have to figure out as we work towards envisioning what a truly just environment in our world would look like. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: That’s something that was addressed a lot in this project. Even the first time I spoke to Jared about the idea of this project, he said to me something like, “I love this song because it makes me feel like I have the right to think about if I ruled the world.” So, in one sense, it’s this really powerful thing because it can redistribute power in this way, but it’s also so oldschool and egotistical. I think another one of the tying threads throughout the work is a conversation around trying to find a way to reframe the question and create a more contemporary, less outdated version of it… </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: What interesting is, I was looking at the manifesto for human rights, which I think is really cool, but what’s totally fascinating is, there’s this line “The president cannot act without the people!” And part of my response to that is, well, do we need a president? I know this was produced with young folks who are just starting to think through these contradictions, but for me there is this, how do we change our thinking enough so that we stop even thinking in these structures? It’s not just that the president needs to answer to the people, but actually that is an antiquated idea and that we have to conceptualize more contemporary forms of self and of governance. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Besan was saying this totally beautiful thing about a one-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where he is saying he does not accept the state of Israel, but he does accept the Jews into Palestine. We were talking about if that is even realistic, and at that point I realized that no nations at all would probably be my most positive vision. Something that shouldn’t of have been there in the first place.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: Does anybody get into the question of kindness in any of the pieces?
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Yeah, Kursten Pickup. She talks about empathy a lot and how lacking it is in our world. She talks about how important empathy is to second-language learning situations. </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: I imagine, I haven’t work that much with refugees, but I imagine there’s a fair amount of trauma that is associated with learning English. The language we speak is so much of who we are. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: I used to think that just speaking English was the powerful thing, but I realized that it’s not, it’s about speaking the “right” type of English. And it’s not something that you can really learn. If you are culturally foreign you will always be, no matter how fluent you are in a language, and people around you pick that up and react to it.</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: They do pick that up and they look at you differently. So, we are back to language again.. Maybe a good question for you, is other than wanting to think through this idea that kept coming up, is what are you hoping this project is going to do? 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: I think a lot of this has just been intuitive. I think that imagination and art and positive thinking are powerful. And I think that by asking people these questions, it’s another way of reminding someone that they are powerful and can take up space and think about such broad things as the fate of the world. I don’t know what this project really aims to do specifically, but I think that when things are difficult, as they always are, that’s maybe just what you have to do, imagine new ways of being. I think I also just didn’t want to be alone in my imagination, I wanted to talk to people and think through what things could be like together.</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: There’s certainly something to be said about, well, you can’t change the world if you don’t know what you want the world to look like. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Yeah, and you can’t know what you want it to look like by yourself. Which is why maybe the collaborative aspect of this project felt so important. </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: But at the same time, I think this work is not just directed at the folks involved in producing it. This project has this very public aspect, it feels like it tries to reach as many people as possible with all of these different forms, and all of these individual pieces that are being produced for the work. So assuming everyone in Baltimore, one way or another, comes into contact with this project, what’s the potential impact? 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Maybe just more people imagining new ways of being. </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: I like the fact that there are so many contradictions in this work. I like contradictions, I find them to be wildly productive. I think that’s one of the things I like about multi-media work is that it does kind of play in contradictions; it brings together all of these different mediums, a collage of images and materials that don’t really go together, but by virtue of the fact that you put them all in the same place, then they must go together. Which is maybe calling back this thing about Besan’s freedom printer; if we say that these things go together, and they are going together, then they must go together. (“If we say we are printing our freedom, and it’s happening now, then that’s what’s happening!”)
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: Yeah, it’s like the poetry again. It’s confusing the standard rules of a type of language. </span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: For sure, poetry is one of these interesting things. Because it depends on what kind of poetry. Some poetry is all about just finding freedom in structure, but at the same time we also think of free verse as poetry and as revolutionary as poetry. Poetry a place to redefine rules and redefine the structure of language in the way that we find most inspiring. So poetry itself is a kind of contradiction. The surrealists were so enamored by the idea of poetry as revolution and revolution as poetry, which I think opened up these new spaces for understanding the world that we live in. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: I’m still trying to think about, what it means to ask someone, who is in Baltimore right now, that question of what you envision for the world, or some of these questions that I asked throughout, like what makes you feel free and what brings you joy? Because I didn’t really have a specific intention in mind, I think I just felt like, “Ok, this is what I want to ask, this is what I want to be talking about.”</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: Just thinking about the Baltimore context, I think those sound like questions that we need right now. What’s happened in Baltimore for the past year, is the result of a much much longer process of systemic oppression and devaluing of human life, on the basis of racial and economic factors. But even understanding that everything that’s happened this year, exists in a much much larger context, it’s been a hard year for Baltimore. It’s been an exciting year in some ways, but it’s also been a terrifying year in the sense that everything changed and nothing changed. So maybe there is some power in just asking those questions and in opening the space up and just about reminding people that they do have the power to think about what a different world would look like. I think that’s what the Uprising was about. It reminded us that we do have the power to speak out, that we do have the power to demand a change. Even though demanding doesn’t necessarily achieve that change. We made some small gains but there’s so much more work ahead of us. So much of that work has to be done by people who have been denied their basic human right to existence. It’s sometimes inconceivable how we might possibly continue with this work, but at that same time, I feel like there are so many new possible conversations, and so many conversations starting. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Even just in daily life, walking around Red Emma’s and talking to folks who hang out here, their conversations, even mundane conversations, just about how people are doing and what’s happening their lives are different. And those conversations wouldn’t of have happened a year ago. I think the Uprising helped us remember that the things that divide us are largely things that neo-liberal contemporary capitalism puts onto us. I think one of the most powerful acts is refusing to stay in the box, to stay in the neighborhoods, or in the red lines that have been drawn that tell us where we can and can’t be. And that was one of the things that was special about the Uprising; for a minutes, it felt like some of those imaginary and invisible lines had actually been erased. I think the question is how do we keep those lines away and banish them for good? And can we actually even do that? And certainly it’s going to take a hell of a lot of imagination and utopian thinking to get us to that point. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I think this project is a lot of things, but i think it’s a step towards that place. It clearly is coming out of some of those same feelings, of maybe this is the time to ask this question and even if the question is problematic and contradictory and we know that, there is still some power in just asking this question.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: And maybe this is the outdated version of the question…</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						KK: And that maybe we do have to start with the outdated version and try to answer it so we can figure out what a better way of even asking this question is. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="kimi">KH: So before we end, I just wanted to ask you some of these things I’ve been asking everyone in the conversations surrounding this project… What if you ruled the world? What brings you joy? What makes you feel free? 
						<br>
						<br>
						So, I’ve lived in a lot of different places, and Baltimore, for me, is the place in the world that has the greatest sense of possibility. Which is something I’ve felt since I first came here. It’s something so unique about this city. And it’s a very melancholic possibility. One of the reasons there is so much sponsibility is because there so much abandonment. There is so much of the city that is underappreciated, and underused, and undervalued, and at the same time, there is an incredible resilience here. Every day I see this more and more in the area I’m in constantly, in Station North, which is a nice segway into the question of what makes me feel free because one of the things that’s been the most inspiring of the course of the last year. Seeing the relationships that we’ve built through this space with the different communities here, and again it is this reminder to me that there are these very unnatural lines that divide us from one another. One of the things that we’ve really sought to do is really scrub out those lines, and not erase them, I mean you can’t erase the pain and hardship that comes with them, but for me, there is this incredible freedom in walking through a space and seeing art students talking to elderly folks who live in the low income housing, and seeing those folks getting to know just everybody. That to me makes me feel free. It reminds me that we have so much power when we are together and when we refuse to be divided. I think that’s also my vision… A world where we are able to exercise our collective power and we are able to find ways to do it that help us to build shared languages that are truly shared, not just one language that replaces others. That’s thinking of language in the sense of English and French and Spanish, but also in the sense of the words we use, and the way we talk about eachother and language in a more broad way of just ways of communication. </span>
